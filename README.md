### Design Changes & Justifications

1. We created a new view interface called ImageView and a corresponding class that implements that
   interface called ImageViewImpl in order to implement the Swing GUI. The existing view interface,
   ImageTextView, was limited to only textual implementations in its ability to display information
   about the image modification program to the user and allow the user to interact with the view.
   Thus, a new view interface was needed that includes all methods necessary for displaying Images
   to the user and interacting with a graphical user interface. The ImageTextView interface, and an
   implementation (ImageTextViewImpl) still exist and function properly for backwards compatibility
   purpose, but all new GUI functionality is supported exclusively through ImageView.
2. Two new ImageOperation function objects were created, DownscaleOperation and MosaicOperation.
   These function object classes apply the downscale and mosaic operations respectively to a given
   Image. Two corresponding Command classes, DownscaleCommand and MosaicCommand, were also created
   in order to add the ability to request the application of these operations through scripting
   commands.
3. The ImageControllerImpl class was slightly modified to add the DownscaleCommand and MosaicCommand
   function objects to the supported operations String to Command Map returned by the getCommands
   method. This modification does not harm any of the previously existing functionality of the
   ImageControllerImpl class, nor does it add enough new functionality to warrant an entirely new
   controller implementation for scripting commands. Adding these two function objects to the Map
   simply allows users of this implementation to utilize the new downscale and mosaic operations in
   their scripts; users can also easily choose not to utilize these new commands and all old scripts
   will not be rendered broken by this addition.
4. We created a Features interface, and a corresponding FeaturesImpl implementation of that
   interface to respond to broadcast from the ImageViewImpl class. FeaturesImpl utilizes the
   subscriber pattern to register itself as a listener for ImageViewImpl. When the user interacts
   with the GUI, ImageViewImpl broadcasts events to its listeners and FeaturesImpl responds by
   calling methods in the controller, which in turn update the model and/or view according to the
   userâ€™s request.
5. We created a new controller interface called ImageInteractiveController, and a corresponding
   class that implements that interface called ImageInteractiveControllerImpl in order to support
   the functionality that FeaturesImpl needs to accurately respond to the events it is listening
   for. The existing controller interface, ImageController, lacked the necessary functionality to
   provide visual response to individual events that FeaturesImpl would need to react to over time (
   rather, it was geared towards reacting to batch commands submitted en masse through scripting and
   not showing the user the resulting Images directly). As a result, the ImageInteractiveController
   interface and its implementation were created to update the model and view in response to
   FeaturesImpl hearing a broadcast event.

### Additional Image Operations

Our application supports two additional features, the downscale and mosaic image operations. To
implement these two new features, two classes were written, DownscaleOperation and MosaicOperation,
that implemented the existing ImageOperation interface. Both classes overrode the apply method,
which takes in an Image object and returns a copy of the Image with the desired operation applied.
Following the command pattern, two classes were written, DownscaleCommand and MosaicCommand, that
implemented the existing Command interface. Both classes overrode the execute method, which
performed the desired operation on the given model using the provided parameter values. This allowed
both operations to be supported through both the new GUI view through menu items and buttons, and
the existing text view through batch commands. In the controller implementation that uses the text
view, commands are stored within a hashmap with their corresponding batch commands. In the
controller implementation that uses the GUI view, commands are executed via the executeCommand
method that executes the given Command with the given input parameters.

### Additional Deliverables

The _res/_ directory contains the following additional deliverables:

- A JAR file, _ImageProcessing.jar_
- A screenshot of the program with an image loaded, _gui.jpg_
- An example script file that demonstrates all the working features of the application, _Script.txt_
- A subdirectory, _downscale/_, that contains an original image, _quetzal_original.jpg_, and two
  downsized versions of that image, _quetzal_half_x_half_y.jpg_ and _quetzal_half_x_quarter_y.jpg_,
  the latter of which has a different width:height ratio than the original image.
- A subdirectory, _mosaic/_, that contains an original image, _popeyes_original.png_, and three
  mosaicked versions of that image, _popeyes_1000_seeds.png_, _popeyes_4000_seeds.png_, and _
  popeyes_8000_seeds.png_, which all have a different number of seeds used.
